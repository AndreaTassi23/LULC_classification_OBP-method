This code was developed within the research Tassi, A.; Gigante, D.; Modica, G.; Di Martino, L.; Vizzari, M. Pixel- vs. Object-Based Landsat 8 Data Classification in Google Earth Engine Using Random Forest: The Case Study of Maiella National Park. Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2299. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13122299

The work aimed to compare and assess pixel-based (PB) and object-based (OB) approaches based on Random Forest (RF) to classify the LULC of the Maiella National Park using Landsat 8 data.
We assessed the advantages of integrating textural information in the pixel-based approach and tested the possibility of using the L8 panchromatic band to improve the segmentation step and the objectâ€™s textural analysis of the object-based approach and produce a 15-m resolution LULC map.


The Google Earth Engine code available is the OBP method that is based on the use of the panchromatic band:
